# Tetrahedral_trees

We address the problem of performing efficient spatial and topological queries on large tetrahedral meshes with arbitrary topology and complex boundaries. Such meshes arise in several application domains, such as 3D Geographic Information Systems (GISs), scientific visualization, and finite element analysis. To this aim, we propose Tetrahedral trees, a family of spatial indexes based on a nested space subdivision (an octree or a kD-tree) and defined by several different subdivision criteria. We provide efficient algorithms for spatial and topological queries on Tetrahedral trees and compare to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results indicate that Tetrahedral trees are an improvement over R*-trees for querying tetrahedral meshes; they are more compact, faster in many queries, and stable at variations of construction thresholds. They also support spatial queries on more general domains than topological data structures, which explicitly encode adjacency information for efficient navigation but have difficulties with domains with a non-trivial geometric or topological shape.

### How to compile ###

The library requires the [boost library](http://www.boost.org/) (for dynamic_bitset class), [qmake](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/qmake-manual.html), and [BitMagic library](http://bitmagic.io/) installed in your system.

In Debian-based OSes (including Ubuntu and Linux Mint) these requirements can be satisfied by running the following command in the terminal:
```
#!

sudo apt install libboost-all-dev qt5-qmake bmagic
```

Once installed, execute from the command line in the root folder of the project the following command:
```
#!

qmake
```
and once configured execute:
```
#!

make
```
This latter command generates an executable in `dist` folder.

The compilation has been test on linux systems.
